        <h2>Garage Door Repair</h2>
        <p>
            Smarr Garage Door has trained technicians to solve all of your garage door, gate openers, and rolling door needs.
            We are IDEA certified to install and repair all rolling steel doors. In addition, we carry the most common parts on all of our trucks,
            which allows us to provide the right solution for most garage door issues immediately.
            Upon arrival, we will evaluate the issue. Once the root cause is identified, we will explain the different options available to solve the problem.
            We will offer our expert advice, but understand that all Customers have different needs and will work to find the best solution for your
            specific situation. In all cases, we try to fix an issue; however, there are times when repairs will not be possible, or safe.
            In these cases, we will offer alternative options such as the new installation of a garage door, or operator. We look forward to our
            Team coming to help solve your garage door needs.
